# Asg1-ID, Monochrome Midnight Website Project
My project is to promote and create a website dedicated just for a band, Monochrome Midnight (fictional). There is four to five important pages, separating all infomation of the band, their tour-related stuff, merchandise, payment methods etc.

Context: Their previous website developer had left the Monochrome Midnight's website as a mess, combining main page together with both tour-related stuff and the Monochrome Midnight's merchandises. Thus, I am hired to essentially "clean up".

# DESIGN PROCESS
This website's design process is through using Weekly CAs as foundation. For inspirations and guides, I had referred to W3Schools website (touched on HTML, CSS, JS), and used ChatGPT to give me suggestions and corrections. I also consulted my Peer Tutor (senior) to guide me on hard coding, because ChatGPT's method did not give me the design outcome I wanted (Particularly for my Home page).

The user of my website is for fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about Monochrome Midnight's history
and who the band members are. To booking them for shows, I had put the band's email at the footer, very bottom of all the pages (excluding Payment page).

Additionally, Monochrome Midnight is interested in selling more of their music/merchandise and getting more gigs. Thus, I created more tour tickets and merchandises. By putting the navigation bar at the top, users can easily switch between the pages and fulfill payment. If they are interested in something to buy, they can add to cart and then proceed to payment.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

I hope to make my website as functional and as easy to be used as possible, fulfilling all the requirements users and the band wants to have.

# FEATURES
Navigation bar and logo: to move around to different pages.

Home page: scroll to read about the band, get a look of their faces and names and then at the bottom is the footer which linked to social media and email. At the New Single Out Now, the Out Now is linked to Spotify.

Tickets page: to look at the venues, countries, dates and amount of the tickets. can press add to cart, which redirects page.

Shop page: where the merchandises are at. can scroll and look at what is available to be bought. add tocart button redirects to cart page also.

Cart page: essentially, whatever is desired to be bought can be typed out and added to the list. afterwards, can press Proceed to Payment to get redirected to Payment page

Payment page: can fill in the form and then type the total amount of what is being bought (already calculated at the cart page) before clicking pay.

Features Left to Implement: make my cart and payment to be better. I think my validation was not done super accurately. make my tickets page to emphasise on the currency.

# TESTING
For testing, I was lost on how to make my cart work like other websites, but since my knowledge on LocalStorage was new, I left it be. Same as for my Payment. As for other pages, they worked well on my browser, so I did not have any issues.
